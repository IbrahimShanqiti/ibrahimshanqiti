        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Dividing a restaurant floor into fair sections takes a lot longer than it should. 
          Working at Queen's Harbor, I figured I could automate it.
        </p>

        <h2>The Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
          The core is a <strong>Seeded Region Growing algorithm</strong>. 
          Three phases:
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>1. Seed Selection</strong></p>
        <p>
          First seed is the table closest to the floor's centroid. Each subsequent seed is chosen 
          using the <strong>maximin distance criterion</strong> — pick the table that maximizes 
          its minimum distance to all existing seeds. This guarantees optimal spatial dispersion.
          Additionally, prechosen adjacency constraints are respected, so tables that shouldn't be in the same section are not.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2. Region Growing</strong></p>
        <p>
          Iteratively expand sections. At each step, grow the section with the lowest current workload 
          by adding an adjacent unassigned table. Workload is calculated as: 
          <code>seats × 1.0 + priority × 0.5</code>. This naturally balances the distribution.
        </p>

        <p><strong>3. Border Refinement</strong></p>
        <p>
          After initial assignment, swap border tables between adjacent sections to minimize 
          workload standard deviation. Uses BFS to verify swaps don't disconnect any section. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>4. Cutting Servers</strong></p>
        <p>
          If the restaurant isn't busy enough to justify having as many servers as there currently are and some servers 
          are cut, the algorithm will simply assign their tables to the remaining servers, ensuring that
          previous sections aren't disrupted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Complexity: <code>O(K × T × N × D²)</code> where T = tables, N = servers, D = avg adjacency, K = refinement iterations. 
          In practice, runs in <strong>&lt;100ms</strong> for typical restaurant layouts.
        </p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Drag-and-drop floor plan editor</li>
          <li>Automatic section generation</li>
          <li>Shift scheduling</li>
          <li>Role-based access</li>
          <li>Multi-location support</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Server View</h2>
        <p>
          Servers can pull up the floor plan on their phones and see their assigned section. 
        </p>

        <h2>Working with Users</h2>
        <p>
          Ran regular demos with managers at Queen's Harbor throughout development. 
          Gathered requirements by watching how they currently assign sections, 
          asked what frustrated them, and iterated based on their feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early versions were too automated — managers wanted manual override options. 
          Added drag-to-reassign after hearing that. Also simplified the UI after 
          observing they only glance at it during busy rushes.
